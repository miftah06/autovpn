# Script: socket.sh
# Description: Implementation of vpn.sh script with additional features for VPN certificate TLS and SSL version 2.2
#              Includes functionality to configure VPN SSH socket and install SSH and other VPN tools as autovpn host
#              Also provides SSL verification for input domain, along with acme.sh option
#              Incorporates features of Xray, Nginx, and Squid to manage connected IP addresses
#              Supports all TCP with HTTP upgrade and keep-alive connections, as well as UDP with HTTP upgrade and HTTP connection using WebSocket proxy connection
#              Stylish and perfect execution with additional yield function

# Example:
#cat <<EOF > /etc/ssh/sshd_config

echo "Installing SSH and other VPN tools as autovpn host..."
# Add installation steps for SSH and other VPN tools here
# Example:
apt-get update
apt-get install -y openssh-server vpn-tool1 vpn-tool2

echo "Verifying SSL for input domain..."
# Add SSL verification steps here
# Example:
# openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -servername example.com

echo "Configuring Xray, Nginx, and Squid..."
# Add configuration steps for Xray, Nginx, and Squid here
# Example:
# Configure Xray to listen on specific ports and protocols
# Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for Xray
# Configure Squid for caching and proxying

echo "Managing connected IP addresses..."
# Add IP address management steps here
# Example:
# Use tools like iptables or fail2ban to manage IP addresses
iptables -A INPUT -s <ip_address> -j DROP
 #To list all blocked IP addresses:
 iptables -L INPUT -v -n | grep DROP
 #For fail2ban, configure jails in /etc/fail2ban/jail.local to monitor specific services and ban IPs
 #Example jail configuration:
 [sshd]
 enabled = true
 port = ssh
 filter = sshd
 logpath = /var/log/auth.log
 maxretry = 3
 banaction = iptables-multiport
 
echo "Configuring TCP and UDP connections..."
# Add configuration for TCP and UDP connections here
# Example:
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT

echo "Executing HTTP upgrade and keep-alive connections..."
# Add execution steps for HTTP upgrade and keep-alive connections here
# Example:
# Configure Nginx to enable HTTP upgrade and keep-alive connections

echo "Executing WebSocket proxy connection..."
# Add execution steps for WebSocket proxy connection here
# Example:
# Configure Nginx to proxy WebSocket connections
# Add execution steps for WebSocket proxy connection here
# Example:
# Configure Nginx to proxy WebSocket connections
# Edit Nginx configuration file, e.g., /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
# Add a location block to proxy WebSocket connections
# Example:
 location /websocket {
#     proxy_pass http://backend_server;
     proxy_http_version 1.1;
     proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
     proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
 }
# Restart Nginx for changes to take effect
 systemctl restart nginx

# Add execution steps for HTTP upgrade and keep-alive connections here
# Example:
# Configure Nginx to enable HTTP upgrade and keep-alive connections
# Edit Nginx configuration file, e.g., /etc/nginx/nginx.conf or /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
# Configure keep-alive connections
# Example:
 keepalive_timeout 65;
# Configure HTTP upgrade
# Example:
 map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
     default upgrade;
     ''      close;
 }
# Apply changes and restart Nginx
 systemctl restart nginx
